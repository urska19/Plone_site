Description: Warning
        =======
        In Plone 5,
        ``plone.app.widgets`` is **obsolete** because it's merged into `plone.app.z3cform <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.z3cform>`_.
        
        Contents
        ========
        The goal of ``plone.app.widgets`` is to provide an implementation for a new set
        of javascript widgets being developed outside Plone as part of `Mockup`_
        project. It overrides explicit widgets used in dexterity and archetypes to
        provide tested and modularized widgets based on the concept of *patterns*.

        Versions
        ========
        
        2.x is only to be used with Plone 5 and 1.x is to be used in Plone 4.3.
        
        Is safe to use this package?
        ============================
        
        This package should be safe to install and easy to uninstall (there is also
        uninstall profile). That means its fairly safe to give it a try, but just in
        case don't forget to create backup before testing it.
        
        As of version 1.4.0 there is quite comprehensive unittest coverage of python
        code as well as high coverage of our javascript code. There are also some robot
        tests which are testing integration with Plone, but this will be improved with
        future releases.
        
        This project will be integrated with Plone 5 and will never reach version
        2.0.0. You can monitor progress of `PLIP here`_.
        
        If you wonder why there is no Alpha/Beta marker in version, its because version
        of this package is kept in sync with other projects deriving from `Mockup`_
        (eg. `plone.app.toolbar`_).  Version 1.4.1 would then mean we're using
        `Mockup`_ version 1.4 and there was one bugfix only to the python code. Version
        packaged javascript inside is still in sync with `Mockup`_ project.
        
        
        What is included?
        =================
        
        The fields that are using updated widgets are:
        
        - **Tags field** (AjaxSelectWidget)
        - **Language field** (SelectWidget)
        - **Effective date field** (DatetimeWidget)
        - **Expire date field** (DatetimeWidget)
        - **Contributors field** (AjaxSelectWidget)
        - **Creators field** (AjaxSelectWidget)
        - **Related items field** (RelatedItemsWidget)
        - **Query string field** (QueryStringWidget) in case `plone.app.contenttypes`_
          is installed.
        
        .. - **Text field** (TinyMCEWidget)
        
        All client side code (javascript/css/images) is done and tested as part of
        `Mockup`_ project.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0.0 (2015-03-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Add Plone 5 warning.
          [gforcada]
        
        - Include TinyMCE languages from mockup.
          [petschki]
        
        - Raise minimum ``Products.CMFPlone`` requirement to 4.3.4 to ensure
          compatibility with jQuery 1.9+. jQuery 1.11.1 is included in recent
          ``mockup``.
          [thet]
        
        - Always include CSS and JS SourceMap files. They are only loaded, when the
          browser's developer console is open. Replaces previous behavior, where
          uninified (and broken) resources were loaded when mockup was installed, which
          was also an ugly implicit development mode behavior.
          [thet]
        
        - Use a mimetype selector for richtext areas, if multiple mimetypes are allowed.
          [thet]
        
        - Allow to remove a selected option in the ``select2`` widget if the field
          is not required
          [frapell]
        
        - Test fixes.
          [thet]
        
        - add jsi18n integration
          [vangheem, kiorky]
        
        
        1.7.0 (2014-07-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove configuration of plone.app.event's ``start`` and ``end`` fields in the
          ``dx_bbb`` module. Requires ``plone.app.event >= 1.2``, which does the widget
          configuration by itself. There is no point in using a previous version of
          plone.app.event together with plone.app.widgets.
          [thet]
        
        - Store RelatedItems in correct order.
          [garbas]
        
        1.6.0 (2014-04-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Add default_timezone widget attribute to the Dexterity DatetimeWidget. If
          used and set to a valid Olson DB/pytz timezone identifier or to an callback
          returning such, the datetime object returned by the widget will be localized
          to that timezone.  This changes the timezone related behavior from version
          1.4.0.
          [thet]
        
        - fix related items widget using getSource when it should use getVocabulary
          [davisagli]

        - make tests pass for plone 5

        - add more tests for richtext widget
          [amleczko]
        
        - fix querystring converter with empty input
          [davisagli]
        
        - add richtext widget support and remove Products.TinyMCE dependency

        - Add sphinx-based documentation.
          [tisto]
        
        - move the AT macros to a browser view
          [davisagli]
        
        - make the profile not do anything on plone 5, which already includes the
          widgets bundle in the plone bundle
          [davisagli]
        
        - Fix tests when portal_tinymce is missing.
          [jaroel]
        
        - Create robot tests for querystring widget
          [ale-rt]
        
        - Add DX tinymce test

        - Fix to import ROBOT_TEST_LEVEL from plone.app.testing.interfaces
          [datakurre]
        
        - RelatedItems widget: use a single selection for Choice fields

        - add support for the tus resumable file upload protocol
          [vangheem]
        
        - handle unicode filenames for dexterity file uploads
          [vangheem]
        
        - just always default to using File objects for uploads that aren't images.
          [vangheem]
        
        
        1.4.0 (2013-11-24)

        - removing bbb.py (SiteRSSItemsFieldWidget and SearchBoxViewlet)
          [garbas]
        
        - For Archetypes DatetimeWidget, the value on pattern options is fixed, which
          was the time component missing.
          [thet]
        
        - Fix the date/time value in pattern options for Archetypes DatetimeWidget.
          [thet]

          [vangheem]
        
        - use select2 widget for ISiteSyndicationSettings

          types to use plone.app.widgets.
          [thet]
        
        - For Dexterity DatetimeWidgetConverter, when converting to the field value,
          try to localize the value, if the old value is a timezone aware datetime
          object. It uses the 'timezone' attribute on the widget's context, if
          available, otherwise UTC.  We do not use the tzinfo object in the first
          place, because it might already be converted from user's input timezone to
          UTC, as it is the case with plone.app.event.
          [thet]
        
        - Support query arguments for function based vocabularies.

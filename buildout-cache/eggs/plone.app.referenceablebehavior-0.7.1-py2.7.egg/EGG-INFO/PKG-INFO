Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The "IReferenceable" behavior is used for enabling UUID (plone.app.uuid) support
        for dexterity contents, like in archetypes content types. This allow for example
        references between archetypes and dexterity content types.
        
        Note: It can't work with Plone==4.0 because it is based on plone.uuid integration in
        CMF. It is compatible with Plone>=4.1
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Just use the behavior "plone.app.referenceablebehavior.referenceable.IReferenceable" in
        your dexterity content type.
        
        In your *profiles/default/types/YOURTYPE.xml* add the behavior::
        
            <?xml version="1.0"?>
            <object name="example.conference.presenter" meta_type="Dexterity FTI"
               i18n:domain="example.conference" xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n">
        
             <!-- enabled behaviors -->
             <property name="behaviors">
                 <element value="plone.app.referenceablebehavior.referenceable.IReferenceable" />
             </property>
        
            </object>
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.7.1 (2015-03-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix tests so they run on jenkins 4.3 - ecosystem
          [maartenkling]
        
        - Ported to plone.app.testing
          [tomgross]
        
        0.7.0 (2014-05-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Slowly reducing AT behaviors. This package still depends on
          Archetypes but does not require its GS Profile to run.
          There are two tools currently provided by AT that are now installed
          with tis profile
          [do3cc]
        
        - Removed unused references to plone.directives.form.
          [do3cc]
        
        
        0.6 (2014-04-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix test failures due to id changes in forms.
          [vanrees]
        
        
        0.5 (2013-01-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a more complete implementation of the IReferenceable interface from
          Archetypes.  Dexterity content using this behavior is now adaptable to
          IReferenceable rather than providing it directly.
          [jpgimenez]
        
        - Import getSite from zope.component to avoid dependency on zope.app.component.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        0.4.2 (2012-08-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Get object's UID in a more proper way.
          [frapell]
        
        
        0.4.1 (2012-08-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix packaging error.
          [esteele]
        
        
        0.4 (2012-08-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Declare the dependency on Archetypes.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Handle IObjectMovedEvent events for referenceable types to avoid
          "unsuccessfully attempted to uncatalog an object" errors when removing
          an object previously moved.
          [frapell]
        
        0.3 (2011-05-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Try obj first in event handlers, fall back to getSite(). When a site is being
          deleted getSite() will return None so isn't useful.
          [lentinj]
        
        0.2 (2011-04-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Use getSite() hook in event handlers, since the object may be
          not acquisition-wrapped in certain circumstances.
          [jbaumann]
        
        - Fix broken IReferenceable import.
          [daftdog]
        
        0.1 (2011-02-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Add "locales" directory and french translation for the behavior.
          [sylvainb]
        
        - Add referenceable behavior to dexterity
          [toutpt]
        
        - Initial release

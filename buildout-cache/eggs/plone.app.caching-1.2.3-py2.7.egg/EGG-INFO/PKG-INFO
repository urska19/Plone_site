        =================
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        ``plone.app.caching`` provides a Plone UI and default rules for managing HTTP response caching in Plone.
        It builds on ``z3c.caching``, ``plone.caching`` and ``plone.cachepurging``.
        
        ``plone.app.caching`` requires Plone 4 or later.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Plone >=4.1
        -----------
        
        **From Plone 4.1 onwards, ``plone.app.caching`` is shipped as a dependency of Plone core.**
        
        It is available from the Control Panel, but **not enabled by default**.
        You can enable it from the "add-ons" menu option.
        
        Plone 4.0
        ---------
        
        Add ``plone.app.caching`` to the ``eggs`` list in your ``buildout.cfg``, or as a dependency of one of your own packages in ``setup.py``.
        ZCML configuration will be automatically loaded via a ``z3c.autoinclude`` entry point.
        You will also need to install the package in Plone's Add-ons control panel as normal.
        
        This package depends on a number of other packages, including ``z3c.form`` and ``plone.app.registry``, that do not ship with Plone 4.0.
        You will probably want to lock down the versions for those packages using a known good set.
        Add this to the the ``extends`` line in your ``buildout.cfg``, *after* the line that includes the Plone KGS::
        
            extends =
                ...
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.caching/1.0a1
        
        Update the version number at the end of the URL as appropriate.
        You can find here an `overview of the versions <http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.caching>`_

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        1.2.3 (2015-05-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed getObjectDefaultView method to strip off leading / and/or @@.
          [alecghica]
        
        - Fix the portalPath used in the controlpanel for manual purging URL's.
          This bug resulted in rarely doing all the purging required.
          [puittenbroek]
        
        
        1.2.2 (2014-10-23)

          [timo]
        
        
        1.1.7 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - Make it possible to set a maxage of zero in strong caching. This is
          an edge case since this would ordinarily be handled by moderate caching.
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Add some testing for weak caching operations.
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Fix handling of anon-only flag for cases where maxage is not zero. It
          was effectively ignored. Added operation test for strong caching.
          [smcmahon]
        
        
        1.1.6 (2013-08-14)

        ------------------
        
        - Register the plone.atobjectfields adapter not only when Products.Archetypes
          but also plone.app.blob is installed.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.1.4 (2013-06-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed purge paths for virtual hosting scenarios using virtual path components.
          [dokai]
        
        
        1.1.3 (2013-03-05)
        ------------------

        1.1.2 (2012-12-27)
        ------------------

          [davisagli]
        
        - Fix bug `12038 <http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12038>`_. If transformIterable
          iterates on the 'result' iterable, it must return a new one.
          [ebrehault]
        
        
        1.1.1 (2012-08-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        1.1 (2012-05-25)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Use zope.browserresource instead of zope.app.publisher.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deprecated methods aliases were replaced on tests.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.0.4 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix possible test failures by logging in with the user name.
          Note that user id and user name (login name) can differ.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.3 (2012-04-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix packaging issue.
          [esteele]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2012-04-15)
        ------------------
        - Handle caching of resource registries in RAM cache by not storing empty
          bodies in the RAMCache
          [eleddy with major tseaver support]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2012-01-26)
        ------------------
        - Properly handle a changed configuration from with etags to no etags by
          forcing a page refresh
          [eleddy]
        
        - When not caching with etags, don't sent an etag header to stop caching
          [eleddy]
        
        - When there was an error like Unauthorized, 200 status and empty body would be
          cached in RAMCache instead of not caching anything.
          This is due to a bug with Zope 2.13 publication events :
          response.status is not set when IPubBeforeAbort is notified.
          Fixed by using error_status stored on request by plone.transformchain.
          [gotcha]
        
        - Added 12 translation strings for ruleset's title and description. Corresponding translation
          strings have been added in plone.app.caching-manual.pot in PloneTranslations
          [giacomos]
        
        - Added 6 translation strings for caching profiles' title and description. Corresponding translation
          strings have been added in plone.app.caching-manual.pot in PloneTranslations
          [giacomos]
        
        - Changed wrong i18n domain in the messagefactory. plone.caching -> plone.app.caching.
          [giacomos]
        
        1.0 - 2011-05-12
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Use the `userLanguage` ETag component in place of the language ETag component
          in the default configs to allow ETags to be used for anonymous users with
          caching.
          [elro]
        
        - Add the SERVER_URL to the RAM cache key.
          [elro]
        
        - Declare `plone.namedfile.scaling.ImageScale` to be a `plone.stableResource`.
          [elro]
        
        - Add MANIFEST.in.
          [WouterVH]
        
        - Fixed tests failing on Zope 2.13 due to the HTTP status no longer being
          included in the response headers.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Add an ILastModified adapter for FSPageTemplate as the FSObject adapter
          would otherwise take precedence.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.0b2 - 2011-02-10
        ------------------
        
        - Added `News Item` to the list of `purgedContentTypes`, so the image field
          and its scales gets purged.
          [stefan, hannosch]
        
        - Associated `file_view`, `image_view` and `image_view_fullscreen` by default
          with the `plone.content.itemView` ruleset, since none of them is the default
          view of their respective content type, they didn't get the automated
          handling.
          [stefan, hannosch]
        
        - Added purging for plone.app.blob's BlobFields.
          [stefan, hannosch]
        
        - Fix documentation to refer to the correct `resourceRegistries` instead of
          the singular version.
          [stefan, hannosch]
        
        - Use plone.registry ``FieldRefs`` to manage parameter overrides. This
          requires plone.app.registry 1.0b3 and plone.app.registry 1.0b3 or later.
          [optilude]
        
        - Update distribution metadata to current best practice.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added an etag component to track the existence of a copy/cut cookie
          [newbery]
        
        - Fixed various i18n issues.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.0b1 - 2010-08-04
        ------------------
        
        - Add an option for "anonymous only" caching to the default operations.
          This is a simple way to switch off caching for logged-in users. See
          the README for more details.
          [optilude]
        
        - Add basic plone.namedfile caching rules, if plone.namedfile is installed
          [optilude]
        
        - Implement lookup based on portal type class/interface as well as name,
          and set up defaults for items and folders.
          [optilude]
        
        - template fixes for cmf.pt compatibility
          [pilz]
        
        
        1.0a1 - 2010-04-24
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release.
